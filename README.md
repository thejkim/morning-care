# morning-care
An iOS weather application that informs the feels like temperature compared to how it was yesterday in the morning, afternoon, and evening. It is for those who are not friendly with numerical temperature. Remembering how much it was hot or cold for you yesterday would be enough! Additionally, it recommends what to wear and what to bring out based on the weather conditions. As everyone feels like differently with the same weather condition, clothing recommendation is updated and customized based on the user's feedback.
